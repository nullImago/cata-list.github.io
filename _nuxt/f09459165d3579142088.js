They turn aside from evidence that is not to their taste, preferring to deify error, if error seduce them.

Indeed, the whole of our social arrangements may be likened to a perpetual comedy; and this is why a man who is worth anything finds society so insipid, while a blockhead is quite at home in it.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"How very paltry and limited the normal human intellect is, and how little lucidity there is in the human consciousness, may be judged from the fact that, despite the ephemeral brevity of human life, the uncertainty of our existence and the countless enigmas which press upon us from all sides, everyone does not continually and ceaselessly philosophize, but that only the rarest of exceptions do.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Isn\'t it sad that you can tell people that the ozone layer is being depleted, the forests are being cut down, the deserts are advancing steadily, that the greenhouse effect will raise the sea level 200 feet, that overpopulation is choking us, that pollution is killing us, that nuclear war may destroy us - and they yawn and settle back for a comfortable nap. But tell them that the Martians are landing, and they scream and run.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"Somebody who reads only newspapers and at best books of contemporary authors appears to me like an extremely near-sighted person who scorns eyeglasses. He is completely dependent on the prejudices and fashions of his times, since he never gets to see or hear anything else. And what a person thinks on his own, without being stimulated by the thoughts and experiences of other people, is, similarly, even in the best case rather paltry and monotonous.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"When I was in high school I asked myself at one point: \'Why do I care if my high school\'s team wins the football game? I don\'t know anybody on the team, they have nothing to do with me... why am I here and applaud? It does not make any sense.\' But the point is, it does make sense: It\'s a way of building up irrational attitudes of submission to authority and group cohesion behind leadership elements. In fact it\'s training in irrational jingoism. That\'s also a feature of competitive sports.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"The inexperienced in wisdom and virtue, ever occupied with feasting and such, are carried downward, and there, as is fitting, they wander their whole life long, neither ever looking upward to the truth above them nor rising toward it, nor tasting pure and lasting pleasures. Like cattle, always looking downward with their heads bent toward the ground and the banquet tables, they feed, fatten, and fornicate. In order to increase their possessions they kick and butt with horns and hoofs of steel and kill each other, insatiable as they are.","author":"Socrates","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Socrates"},{"quote":"A group experience takes place on a lower level of consciousness than the experience of an individual. This is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psyche. If it is a very large group, the collective psyche will be more like the psyche of an animal, which is the reason why the ethical attitude of large organizations is always doubtful. The psychology of a large crowd inevitably sinks to the level of mob psychology.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"Mass education was designed to turn independent farmers into docile, passive tools of production. That was its primary purpose. And don\'t think people didn\'t know it. They knew it and they fought against it. There was a lot of resistance to mass education for exactly that reason. It was also understood by the elites. The anti-democratic thrust of opinion in what are called democratic societies is really ferocious. And for good reason. Because the freer the society gets, the more dangerous the great beast becomes and the more you have to be careful to cage it somehow.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"It is really incredible how meaningless and insignificant when seen from without, and how dull and senseless when felt from within, is the course of life of the great majority of men. It is weary longing and worrying, a dreamlike staggering through the four ages of life to death, accompanied by a series of trivial thoughts. They are like clockwork that is wound up and goes without knowing why. Every time a man is begotten and born the clock of human life is wound up anew, to repeat once more its same old tune that has already been played innumerable times, movement by movement and measure by measure, with insignificant variations.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Ordinary society is, in this respect, very like the kind of music to be obtained from an orchestra composed of Russian horns. Each horn has only one note; and the music is produced by each note coming in just at the right moment. In the monotonous sound of a single horn, you have a precise illustration of the effect of most people\'s minds. How often there seems to be only one thought there! and no room for any other. It is easy to see why people are so bored; and also why they are sociable, why they like to go about in crowds—why mankind is so gregarious. It is the monotony of his own nature that makes a man find solitude intolerable.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Early theorists of group psychology had tried to explain why men were so sheeplike when they functioned in groups. They developed ideal like \'mental contagion\' and \'herd instinct,\' which became very popular. But as Freud was quick to see, these ideas never really did explain what men did with their judgment and common sense when they got caught up in groups. Freud saw right away what they did with it: they simply became dependent children again, blindly following the inner voice of their parents, which now came to them under the hypnotic spell of the leader. They abandoned their egos to his, identified with his power, tried to function with him as an ideal.","author":"Ernest Becker","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker"},{"quote":"The result of this mental dullness is that inner vacuity and emptiness that is stamped on innumerable faces and also betrays itself in a constant and lively attention to all events in the external world, even the most trivial. This vacuity is the real source of boredom and always craves for external excitement in order to set the mind and spirits in motion through something. Therefore in the choice thereof it is not fastidious, as is testified by the miserable and wretched pastimes to which people have recourse. … The principal result of this inner vacuity is the craze for society, diversion, amusement, and luxury of every kind which lead many to extravagance and so to misery.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"I consider that the matter of defining what is real — that is a serious topic, even a vital topic. And in there somewhere is the other topic, the definition of the authentic human. Because the bombardment of pseudo- realities begins to produce inauthentic humans very quickly, spurious humans — as fake as the data pressing at them from all sides. My two topics are really one topic; they unite at this point. Fake realities will create fake humans. Or, fake humans will generate fake realities and then sell them to other humans, turning them, eventually, into forgeries of themselves. So we wind up with fake humans inventing fake realities and then peddling them to other fake humans. It is just a very large version of Disneyland.","author":"Philip K. Dick","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick"},{"quote":"In so far as society is itself composed of de-individualized human beings, it is completely at the mercy of ruthless individualists. Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes – it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hand of a single madman. Unfortunately, this realization does not seem to have penetrated very far - and our blindness is extremely dangerous.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish the illusion of individuality, but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too... Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed.","author":"Aldous Huxley","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"}]},{"name":"Individuality","slug":"individuality","quotes":[{"quote":"Dare to think for yourself.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"An unexamined life is not worth living.","author":"Socrates","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Socrates"},{"quote":"The happiest of all lives is a busy solitude.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"There\'s no coming to consciousness without pain.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"In each of us there is another whom we do not know.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"The bigger the crowd, the more negligible the individual.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are.","author":"Carl Jung","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Carl_Jung"},{"quote":"The higher we soar the smaller we appear to those who cannot fly.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"To become what one is, one must not have the faintest idea what one is.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"To stand alone against all adversity is the most sacred moment of existence.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"The high-minded person must care more for the truth than for what people think.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.","author":"Marcus Aurelius","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius"},{"quote":"All persons ought to endeavor to follow what is right, and not what is established.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"The more powerful and original a mind, the more it will incline towards the religion of solitude.","author":"Aldous Huxley","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"},{"quote":"Look within.

The latent totality of the pine in the seed reacts to these cicumstances by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the sun, with the result that the tree\'s growth is shaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes into existence, constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergence into the realm of reality. Without the living tree, the image of the pine is only a possibility or an abstract idea.

Society wants to be the one to decide how people are to transcend death; it will tolerate the causa-sui project only if it fits into the standard social project.

But what is it that constrains the individual to fear his neighbor, to think and act like a member of a herd, and to have no joy in himself? Modesty, perhaps, in a few rare cases. With the great majority it is indolence, inertia. … Men are even lazier than they are timid, and fear most of all the inconveniences with which unconditional honesty and nakedness would burden them.

But this, finally, is not easy, since some of the masks cut deep. They include judgment and moral values. They include one\'s pride, ambition, and achievement. They include one\'s infatuations. It is a common thing to be overly impressed by and attached to masks, either some mask of one\'s own or the mana-masks of others. The work of individuation, however, demands that one should not be compulsively affected in this way. The aim of individuation requires that one should find and then learn to live out of one\'s own center, in control of one\'s for and against.

It is too good for that; my head shall be active only in its own service; it shall try to comprehend the wondrous and varied spectacle of this world\', and then reproduce it in some form, whether as art or as literature, that may answer to my character as an individual.

He must obey his own law, as if it were a daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths... There are not a few who are called awake by the summons of the voice, whereupon they are at once set apart from the others, feeling themselves confronted with a problem about which the others know nothing. In most cases it is impossible to explain to the others what has happened, for any understanding is walled off by impenetrable prejudices. \'You are no different from anybody else,\' they will chorus or, \'there\'s no such thing\', and even if there is such a thing, it is immediately branded as \'morbid\'...

But he knows better: it is the law...The only meaningful life is a life that strives for the individual realization--absolute and unconditional--of its own particular law...To the extent that a man is untrue to the law of his being...he has failed to realize his own life\'s meaning.

Kierkegaard calls this type of man the \'introvert.\' He is a little more concerned with what it means to be a person, with individuality and uniqueness. He enjoys solitude and withdraws periodically to reflect, perhaps to nurse ideas about his secret self, what it might be. This, after all is said and done, is the only real problem of life, the only worthwhile occupation preoccupation of man: What is one\'s true talent, his secret gift, his authentic vocation? In what way is one truly unique, and how can he express this uniqueness, give it form, dedicate it to something beyond himself? How can the person take his private inner being, the great mystery that he feels at the heart of himself, his emotions, his yearnings, and use them to live more distinctively, to enrich both himself and mankind with the peculiar quality of his talent? In adolescence, most of us throb with this dilemma, expressing it either with words and thoughts or with simple numb pain and longing. But usually life suck us up into standardized activities. The social hero-system into which we are born marks out paths for our heroism, paths to which we conform, to which we shape ourselves so that we can please others, become what they expect us to be. And instead of working our inner secret we gradually cover it over and forget it, while we become purely external men, playing successfully the standardized hero-game into which we happen to fall by accident, by family connection, by reflex patriotism, or by the simple need to eat and the urge to procreate.","author":"Ernest Becker","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker"}]},{"name":"Purpose","slug":"purpose","quotes":[{"quote":"You are the Hero of your own Story.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"We are the ones we have been waiting for.","author":"Unknown","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page"},{"quote":"Happiness belongs to the self-sufficient.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"The first and best victory is to conquer self.","author":"Plato","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Plato"},{"quote":"Freedom is obedience to self-formulated rules.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Self-sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth.","author":"Epicurus","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Epicurus"},{"quote":"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Every man is guilty of all the good he did not do.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"True nobility is being superior to your former self.","author":"Ernest Hemingway","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway"},{"quote":"The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"Chiefly the mold of a man\'s fortune is in his own hands.","author":"Francis Bacon","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"},{"quote":"In an evolving world, he who stands still moves backward.","author":"Unknown","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page"},{"quote":"It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.","author":"Unknown","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page"},{"quote":"He who has a \'Why?\' in life can tolerate almost any \'How?\'.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"Fortune is powerless to help one who does not exert himself.","author":"Leonardo Da Vinci","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"quote":"The problem is not to find the answer, it\'s to face the answer.","author":"Terence McKenna","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna"},{"quote":"You must have a plan or you will become a part of someone else\'s.","author":"Terence McKenna","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna"},{"quote":"The troubles of modern life come from being divorced from nature.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"You become mature when you become the authority of your own life.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself.","author":"Leonardo Da Vinci","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"quote":"The best way to help mankind is through the perfection of yourself.","author":"Joseph Campbell","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell"},{"quote":"The best contribution one can make to humanity is to improve oneself.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.","author":"Elon Musk","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Elon_Musk"},{"quote":"Men exist for the sake of one another.

Without the sense of fellowship with men of like mind, of preoccupation with the objective, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific research, life would have seemed to me empty. The ordinary objects of human endeavor — property, outward success, luxury — have always seemed to me contemptible.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"A human being is a part of the whole, called by us \'Universe\', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"It\'s very important that people take back their minds and that people analyse our dilemma in the context of the entire human story from the descent onto the grassland to our potential destiny as citizens of the galaxy and the universe. We are at a critical turning point and, as I say, the tools, the data that holds the potential for our salvation is now known, it is available; it is among us, but it is misrepresented, it is slandered, it is litigated against, and it\'s up to each one of us to relate to this situation in a fashion that will allow us to answer the question that will surely be put to us at some point in the future, which is: What did you do to help save the world?","author":"Terence McKenna","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna"},{"quote":"Self-knowledge leads to wonder, and wonder to curiosity and investigation, so that nothing interests people more than people, even if only one\'s own person. Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most difficult of all things to know. For the human organism is, apparently, the most complex of all organisms, and while one has the advantage of knowing one\'s own organism so intimately—from the inside—there is also the disadvantage of being so close to it that one can never quite get at it. Nothing so eludes conscious inspection as consciousness itself. This is why the root of consciousness has been called, paradoxically, the unconscious.","author":"Alan Watts","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Watts"},{"quote":"How does one transcend himself; how does he open himself to new possibility? By realizing the truth of his situation, by dispelling the lie of his character, by breaking his spirit out of its conditioned prison. The enemy, for Kierkegaard as for Freud, is the Oedipus complex. The child has built up strategies and techniques for keeping his self-esteem in the face of the terror of his situation. These techniques become an armor that hold the person prisoner. The very defenses that he needs in order to move about with self-confidence and self-esteem become his life-long trap. In order to transcend himself he must break down that which he needs in order to live. Like Lear he must throw off all his \'cultural lendings\' and stand naked in the storm of life. Kierkegaard had no illusions about man\'s urge to freedom. He knew how comfortable people were inside the prison of their character defenses. Like many prisoners they are comfortable in their limited and protected routines, and the idea of a parole into the wide world of chance, accident, and choice terrifies them.","author":"Ernest Becker","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ernest_Becker"}]},{"name":"Government","slug":"government","quotes":[{"quote":"Nationalism is an infantile disease.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Force always attracts men of low morality.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Bureaucracy is the death of all sound work.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Poverty is the parent of revolution and crime.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty.","author":"Thomas Jefferson","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"},{"quote":"Distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"You don\'t need a formal conspiracy when interests converge.","author":"George Carlin","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Carlin"},{"quote":"Laws to suppress tend to strengthen what they would prohibit.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"A state of war only serves as an excuse for domestic tyranny.","author":"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn"},{"quote":"A politician divides mankind into two classes: tools and enemies.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"A State can be no better than the citizens of which it is composed.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"Naturally, any conqueror is going to play one group against another.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"Nothing doth more hurt in a state than that cunning men pass for wise.","author":"Francis Bacon","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"},{"quote":"Unlimited power in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty.","author":"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn"},{"quote":"Which is the best government?

Find some common desire, some widespread unconscious fear or anxiety; think out some way to relate this wish or fear to the product you have to sell; then build a bridge of verbal or pictorial symbols over which your customer can pass from fact to compensatory dream, and from the dream to the illusion that your product, when purchased, will make the dream come true.

This is not the case. The opposite is true: morality is higher than law! Law is our human attempt to embody in rules a part of that moral sphere which is above us. We try to understand this morality, bring it down to earth, and present it in the form of law. Sometimes we are more successful, sometimes less.

Small-scale production carried on by individuals who own the instruments with which they personally work is not subject to periodical slumps. Furthermore, the ownership of the means of small-scale, personal production has none of the disastrous political, economic and psychological consequences of large-scale production-loss of independence, enslavement to an employer, insecurity of the tenure of employment.","author":"Aldous Huxley","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"},{"quote":"Case by case, we find that conformity is the easy way, and the path to privilege and prestige; dissidence carries personal costs that may be severe, even in a society that lacks such means of control as death squads, psychiatric prisons, or extermination camps. The very structure of the media is designed to induce conformity to established doctrine.

The man who is endowed with important personal qualities will be only too ready to see clearly in what respects his own nation falls short, since their failings will be constantly before his eyes.

The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat.

We\'re dealing with real human beings who are suffering and dying and being tortured and starving because of policies that we are involved in, we as citizens of democratic societies are directly involved in and are responsible for, and what the media are doing is ensuring that we do not act on our responsibilities, and that the interests of power are served, not the needs of the suffering people, and not even the needs of the American people who would be horrified if they realized the blood that\'s dripping from their hands because of the way they are allowing themselves to be deluded and manipulated by the system.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"Unless we choose to decentralize and to use applied science, not as the end to which human beings are to be made the means, but as the means to producing a race of free individuals, we have only two alternatives to choose from: either a number of national, militarized totalitarianisms, having as their root the terror of the atomic bomb and as their consequence the destruction of civilization (or, if the warfare is limited, the perpetuation of militarism); or else one supra-national totalitarianism, called into existence by the social chaos resulting from rapid technological progress in general and the atomic revolution in particular, and developing, under the need for efficiency and stability, into the welfare-tyranny of Utopia.","author":"Aldous Huxley","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"},{"quote":"We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors.

It is a crisis brought about by evolution being intent on completely integrating differently colored, differently cultured, and intercommunicating humanity, and by evolution being intent on making integrated humanity able to live sustainedly at a higher standard of living for all than has ever been experienced by any. Probably ninety-nine percent of humanity does not know that we have the option to make it ; we do. It can only be accomplished, however, through a Design Science Revolution. Those in supreme power, politically and economically, aren\'t yet convinced that our Planet Earth has anywhere nearly enough life support for all humanity.

Our ideas of organisation, our different religions, our different economic systems, our ideas about it are the world. We are heading for a radical revision where you could say we are heading towards the end of the world, but more in the R.E.M. sense than the Revelation sense. That is what apocalypse means – revelation. I could square that with the end of the world, a revelation, a new way of looking at things, something that completely radicalises our notions of the where we were, when we were, what we were, something like that would constitute an end to the world in the kind of abstract – yet very real sense – that I am talking about. A change in the language, a change in the thinking, a change in the music. It wouldn\'t take much – one big scientific idea, or artistic idea, one good book, one good painting – who knows – we are at a critical point where the ideas are coming thicker and faster and stranger and stranger than they ever were before. They are realised at a greater speed, everything has become very fluid.","author":"Alan Moore","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Moore"},{"quote":"Most people find the word Apocalypse to be a terrifying concept. Checked in the dictionary, it means only revelation, although it obviously has also come to mean end of the world. As to what the end of the world means, I would say that probably depends on what we mean by world. I don\'t think this means the planet, or even the life forms upon the planet. I think the world is purely a construction of ideas, and not just the physical structures, but the mental structures, the ideologies that we\'ve erected, that is what I would call the world. Our political structures, philosophical structures, ideological frameworks, economies. These are actually imaginary things, and yet that is the framework that we have built our entire world upon. It strikes me that a strong enough wave of information could completely overturn and destroy all of that. A sudden realization that would change our entire perspective upon who we are and how we exist. History is a heat, it is the heat of accumulated information and accumulated complexity. As our culture progresses, we find that we gather more and more information and that we slowly start to move almost from a fluid to a vaporous state, as we approach the ultimate complexity of a social boiling point. I believe that our culture is turning to steam.","author":"Alan Moore","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Moore"}]},{"name":"Learning","slug":"learning","quotes":[{"quote":"Knowledge is power.","author":"Francis Bacon","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"},{"quote":"Love truth, but pardon error.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"Experience teaches only the teachable.","author":"Aldous Huxley","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"},{"quote":"Education is a system of imposed ignorance.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"The more you know, the more you know you don\'t know.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"He is a poor pupil who does not go beyond his master.","author":"Leonardo Da Vinci","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"quote":"No problem can stand the assault of sustained thinking.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"Judge a man by his questions rather than by his answers.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"The least deviation from truth will be multiplied later.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Science can flourish only in an atmosphere of free speech.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Learning is not child\'s play; we cannot learn without pain.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.","author":"Leonardo Da Vinci","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci"},{"quote":"Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"One repays a teacher badly if one always remains nothing but a pupil.","author":"Friedrich Nietzsche","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche"},{"quote":"Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.","author":"Aristotle","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aristotle"},{"quote":"Doubt is an uncomfortable condition, but certainty is a ridiculous one.","author":"Voltaire","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Voltaire"},{"quote":"Life is like riding a bicycle.

You have everybody looking forward to no longer learning, and you make them ashamed afterward of going back to learning.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"Today, what people call learning is forced on you. Everyone is forced to learn the same thing on the same day at the same speed in class. But everyone is different. For some, class goes too fast, for some too slow, for some in the wrong direction. But give everyone a chance, in addition to school, to follow up their own bent from the start, to find out about whatever they\'re interested in by looking it up in their own homes, at their own speed, in their own time, and everyone will enjoy learning.","author":"Isaac Asimov","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov"},{"quote":"For the man who studies to gain insight, books and studies are merely rungs of the ladder on which he climbs to the summit of knowledge. As soon as a rung has raised him up one step, he leaves it behind. On the other hand, the many who study in order to fill their memory do not use the rungs of the ladder for climbing, but take them off and load themselves with them to take away, rejoicing at the increasing weight of the burden. They remain below forever, because they bear what should have bourne them.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Every fact of science was once Damned. Every invention was considered impossible. Every discovery was a nervous shock to some orthodoxy. Every artistic innovation was denounced as fraud and folly. The entire web of culture and \'progress\', everything on earth that is man-made and not given to us by nature, is the concrete manifestation of some man\'s refusal to bow to Authority. We would own no more, know no more, and be no more than the first apelike hominids if it were not for the rebellious, the recalcitrant, and the intransigent.","author":"Robert Anton Wilson","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson"},{"quote":"School failed me, and I failed the school. It bored me. The teachers behaved like Feldwebel (sergeants). I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam. What I hated most was the competitive system there, and especially sports. Because of this, I wasn\'t worth anything, and several times they suggested I leave. I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled by my teachers; grades were their only measurement. How can a teacher understand youth with such a system? ... From the age of twelve I began to suspect authority and distrust teachers.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"The gravest error a thinking person can make is to believe that one particular version of history is absolute fact. History is recorded by a series of observers, none of whom is impartial. The facts are distorted by sheer passage of time and thousands of years of humanity\'s dark ages, deliberate misrepresentations by religious sects, and the inevitable corruption that comes from an accumulation of careless mistakes. The wise person, then, views history as a set of lessons to be learned, choices and ramifications to be considered and discussed, and mistakes that should never again be made.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"We are in an age that assumes the narrowing trends of specialization to be logical, natural, and desirable. Consequently, society expects all earnestly responsible communication to be crisply brief... In the meantime, humanity has been deprived of comprehensive understanding. Specialization has bred feelings of isolation, futility, and confusion in individuals. It has also resulted in the individual\'s leaving responsibility for thinking and social action to others. Specialization breeds biases that ultimately aggregate as international and ideological discord, which, in turn, leads to war.","author":"Bucky Fuller","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller"},{"quote":"Most problems of teaching are not problems of growth but helping cultivate growth. As far as I know, and this is only from personal experience in teaching, I think about ninety percent of the problem in teaching, or maybe ninety-eight percent, is just to help the students get interested. Or what it usually amounts to is to not prevent them from being interested. Typically they come in interested, and the process of education is a way of driving that defect out of their minds. But if children\'s ... normal interest is maintained or even aroused, they can do all kinds of things in ways we don\'t understand.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"},{"quote":"Truth that has been merely learned is like an artificial limb, a false tooth, a waxen nose; at best, like a nose made out of another\'s flesh; it adheres to us only because it is put on. But truth acquired by thinking of our own is like a natural limb; it alone really belongs to us. This is the fundamental difference between the thinker and the mere man of learning. The intellectual attainments of a man who thinks for himself resemble a fine painting, where the light and shade are correct, the tone sustained, the colour perfectly harmonised; it is true to life. On the other hand, the intellectual attainments of the mere man of learning are like a large palette, full of all sorts of colours, which at most are systematically arranged, but devoid of harmony, connection and meaning.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"It is not enough to teach a man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he—with his specialized knowledge—more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community. These precious things are conveyed to the younger generation through personal contact with those who teach, not—or at least not in the main—through textbooks. It is this that primarily constitutes and preserves culture. This is what I have in mind when I recommend the humanities as important, not just dry specialized knowledge in the fields of history and philosophy.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"To be truly educated means to be in a position to inquire and to create on the basis of the resources available to you which you\'ve come to appreciate and comprehend. To know where to look, to know how to formulate serious questions, to question a standard doctrine if that\'s appropriate, to find your own way, to shape the questions that are worth pursuing, and to develop the path to pursue them. That means knowing, understanding many things but also, much more important than what you have stored in your mind, to know where to look, how to look, how to question, how to challenge, how to proceed independently, to deal with the challenges that the world presents to you and that you develop in the course of your self education and inquiry and investigations, in cooperation and solidarity with others. That\'s what an educational system should cultivate from kindergarten to graduate school, and in the best cases sometimes does, and that leads to people who are, at least by my standards, well educated.","author":"Noam Chomsky","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky"}]},{"name":"Spirituality","slug":"spirituality","quotes":[{"quote":"Change alone is eternal, perpetual, immortal.","author":"Arthur Schopenhauer","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer"},{"quote":"Life is a mask through which the universe expresses itself.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"Reality is merely an illusion.

You can know it without fail because it awakens within you that sensation which tells you this is something you\'ve always known.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"Science is never finished because the human mind only uses a small portion of its capacity, and man\'s exploration of his world is also limited. If we look at this tree outside whose roots search beneath the pavement for water, or a flower which sends its sweet smell to the pollinating bees, or even our own selves and the inner forces that drive us to act, we can see that we all dance to a mysterious tune, and the piper who plays this melody from an inscrutable distance — whatever name we give him — Creative Force, or God — escapes all book knowledge.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"When we are in control of everything and we have great panels of push buttons whereby the slightest touch fulfills every wish, what will we want then? We will eventually want to arrange to have a special, red button marked \'surprise\' built into the panel. Touch that button and what happens? We will suddenly disappear from our normal consciousness and find ourselves in a situation very much like the one we are now in, where we feel ourselves to be a little bit out of control, subject to surprises, and subject to the whims of an unpredictable universe.","author":"Alan Watts","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Watts"},{"quote":"Words are man\'s first and most grandiose invention. With language he created a whole new universe; what wonder if he loved words and attributed power to them! With fitted, harmonious words the magicians summoned rabbits out of empty hats and spirits from the elements. Their descendants, the literary men, still go on with the process, morticing their verbal formulas together, and, before the power of the finished spell, trembling with delight and awe. Rabbits out of empty hats? No, their spells are more subtly powerful, for they evoke emotions out of empty minds.","author":"Aldous Huxley","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aldous_Huxley"},{"quote":"This is the awe-inspiring universe of magic: There are no atoms, only waves and motions all around. Here, you discard all belief in barriers to understanding. You put aside understanding itself. This universe cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be detected in any way by fixed perceptions. It is the ultimate void where no preordained screens occur upon which forms may be projected. You have only one awareness here—the screen of the magi: Imagination! Here, you learn what it is to be human. You are a creator of order, of beautiful shapes and systems, an organizer of chaos.","author":"Frank Herbert","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert"},{"quote":"The moral decline we are compelled to witness and the suffering it engenders are so oppressive that one cannot ignore them even for a moment. No matter how deeply one immerses oneself in work, a haunting feeling of inescapable tragedy persists. Still, there are moments when one feels free from one\'s own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery — even if mixed with fear — that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man.","author":"Albert Einstein","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"},{"quote":"Our life consists not in the pursuit of material success but in the quest for worthy spiritual growth. Our entire earthly existence is but a transitional stage in the movement toward something higher, and we must not stumble and fall, nor must we linger fruitlessly on one rung of the ladder. Material laws alone do not explain our life or give it direction. The laws of physics and physiology will never reveal the indisputable manner in which the Creator constantly, day in and day out, participates in the life of each of us, unfailingly granting us the energy of existence; when this assistance leaves us, we die. And in the life of our entire planet, the Divine Spirit surely moves with no less force: this we must grasp in our dark and terrible hour.","author":"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn"},{"quote":"It strikes me that self, not just my self, but all self, the phenomenon of self, is perhaps one field, one consciousness – perhaps there is only one ‘I\', perhaps our brains, our selves, our entire identity is little more than a label on a waveband.

Over there – he points to another table in the pizza restaurant – it happens to believe it is something else.

And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say \'Well, that was pretty great.\' But now let\'s have a surprise. Let\'s have a dream which isn\'t under control. Where something is gonna happen to me that I don\'t know what it\'s going to be. And you would dig that and come out of that and say \'Wow, that was a close shave, wasn\'t it?\' And then you would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream.

And these, with all their beast-heats, crowns and lightings, all their different colors, are become combined into the single whiteness that is godhead; that is all. This, then, is revelation. All is one, and all is deity, this beautiful undying fire of being that is everywhere about us; that we are. O man, o woman, know yourself, and know you are divine.

This is understood as being the Great Work, as being the gold the alchemists sought, as being the Will, the Soul, the thing we have inside us that is behind the intellect, the body, the dreams. The inner dynamo of us, if you like. Now this is the single most important thing that we can ever attain, the knowledge of our own Self. And yet there are a frightening amount of people who seem to have the urge not just to ignore the Self, but actually seem to have the urge to obliterate themselves. This is horrific, but you can almost understand the desire to simply wipe out that awareness, because it\'s too much of a responsibility to actually posses such a thing as a soul, such a precious thing. What if you break it? What if you lose it? Mightn\'t it be best to anesthetize it, to deaden it, to destroy it, to not have to live with the pain of struggling towards it and trying to keep it pure? I think that the way that people immerse themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in television, in any of the addictions that our culture throws up, can be seen as a deliberate attempt to destroy any connection between themselves and the responsibility of accepting and owning a higher Self and then having to maintain it.","author":"Alan Moore","link":"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alan_Moore"}]},{"name":"Albert Einstein","slug":"einstein","bio":"Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist.

If we look at this tree outside whose roots search beneath the pavement for water, or a flower which sends its sweet smell to the pollinating bees, or even our own selves and the inner forces that drive us to act, we can see that we all dance to a mysterious tune, and the piper who plays this melody from an inscrutable distance—whatever name we give him—Creative Force, or God—escapes all book knowledge","source":""},{"quote":"School failed me, and I failed the school. It bored me. The teachers behaved like Feldwebel (sergeants). I wanted to learn what I wanted to know, but they wanted me to learn for the exam. What I hated most was the competitive system there, and especially sports. Because of this, I wasn\'t worth anything, and several times they suggested I leave. I felt that my thirst for knowledge was being strangled by my teachers; grades were their only measurement. How can a teacher understand youth with such a system? . . . from the age of twelve I began to suspect authority and distrust teachers","source":""},{"quote":"I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves — such an ethical basis I call more proper for a herd of swine. The ideals which have lighted me on my way and time after time given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Truth, Goodness, and Beauty. Without the sense of fellowship with men of like mind, of preoccupation with the objective, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific research, life would have seemed to me empty. The ordinary objects of human endeavor — property, outward success, luxury — have always seemed to me contemptible.","source":""},{"quote":"The moral decline we are compelled to witness and the suffering it engenders are so oppressive that one cannot ignore them even for a moment. No matter how deeply one immerses oneself in work, a haunting feeling of inescapable tragedy persists. Still, there are moments when one feels free from one\'s own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being.","source":""},{"quote":"In human freedom in the philosophical sense I am definitely a disbeliever. Everybody acts not only under external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity. Schopenhauer\'s saying, that a man can do as he will, but not will as he will, has been an inspiration to me since my youth up, and a continual consolation and unfailing well-spring of patience in the face of the hardships of life, my own and others\'. This feeling mercifully mitigates the sense of responsibility which so easily becomes paralyzing, and it prevents us from taking ourselves and other people too seriously; it conduces to a view of life in which humor, above all, has its due place.","source":""},{"quote":"How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people — first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...","source":""},{"quote":"A human being is a part of the whole, called by us \'Universe\', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.","source":""},{"quote":"The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery — even if mixed with fear — that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man.","source":""},{"quote":"It would not be difficult to come to an agreement as to what we understand by science. Science is the century-old endeavor to bring together by means of systematic thought the perceptible phenomena of this world into as thoroughgoing an association as possible. To put it boldly, it is the attempt at the posterior reconstruction of existence by the process of conceptualization. But when asking myself what religion is I cannot think of the answer so easily. And even after finding an answer which may satisfy me at this particular moment, I still remain convinced that I can never under any circumstances bring together, even to a slight extent, the thoughts of all those who have given this question serious consideration.","source":""},{"quote":"Beneath the effort directed toward the accumulation of worldly goods lies all too frequently the illusion that this is the most substantial and desirable end to be achieved; but there is, fortunately, a minority composed of those who recognize early in their lives that the most beautiful and satisfying experiences open to humankind are not derived from the outside, but are bound up with the development of the individual\'s own feeling, thinking and acting. The genuine artists, investigators and thinkers have always been persons of this kind. However inconspicuously the life of these individuals runs its course, none the less the fruits of their endeavors are the most valuable contributions which one generation can make to its successors.","source":""},{"quote":"I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God.","source":""},{"quote":"One of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one\'s own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought. With this negative motive goes a positive one. Man seeks to form for himself, in whatever manner is suitable for him, a simplified and lucid image of the world, and so to overcome the world of experience by striving to replace it to some extent by this image. This is what the painter does, and the poet, the speculative philosopher, the natural scientist, each in his own way. Into this image and its formation, he places the center of gravity of his emotional life, in order to attain the peace and serenity that he cannot find within the narrow confines of swirling personal experience.","source":""},{"quote":"It is not enough to teach a man a specialty. Through it he may become a kind of useful machine but not a harmoniously developed personality. It is essential that the student acquire an understanding of and a lively feeling for values. He must acquire a vivid sense of the beautiful and of the morally good. Otherwise he—with his specialized knowledge—more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. He must learn to understand the motives of human beings, their illusions, and their sufferings in order to acquire a proper relationship to individual fellow-men and to the community. These precious things are conveyed to the younger generation through personal contact with those who teach, not—or at least not in the main—through textbooks. It is this that primarily constitutes and preserves culture. This is what I have in mind when I recommend the humanities as important, not just dry specialized knowledge in the fields of history and philosophy.","source":""},{"quote":"The world needs new moral impulses which, I\'m afraid, won\'t come from the churches, heavily compromised as they have been throughout the centuries. Perhaps those impulses must come from scientists in the tradition of Galileo, Kepler and Newton. In spite of failures and persecutions, these men devoted their lives to proving that the universe is a single entity, in which, I believe, a humanized God has no place. The genuine scientist is not moved by praise or blame, nor does he preach. He unveils the universe and people come eagerly, without being pushed, to behold a new revelation: the order, the harmony, the magnificence of creation! And as man becomes conscious of the stupendous laws that govern the universe in perfect harmony, he begins to realize how small he is. He sees the pettiness of human existence, with its ambitions and intrigues, its \'I am better than thou\' creed. This is the beginning of cosmic religion within him; fellowship and human service become his moral code. And without such moral foundations, we are hopelessly doomed","source":""},{"quote":"Common to all these types is the anthropomorphic character of the idea of God. Only exceptionally gifted individuals or especially noble communities rise essentially above this level; in these there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of God; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance. Indications of this cosmic religious sense can be found even on earlier levels of development—for example, in the Psalms of David and in the Prophets. The cosmic element is much stronger in Buddhism, as, in particular, Schopenhauer\'s magnificent essays have shown us. The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor God made in man\'s image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints","source":""}]},{"name":"Arthur Schopenhauer","slug":"schopenhauer","bio":"Arthur Schopenhauer was a German philosopher whose work has had an impact across various disciplines, including philosophy, literature, and science.

It is not long before they must yield their place; nay, the light they give is reflected only, and the sphere of their influence is confined to their orbit — their contemporaries. Their path is one of change and movement, and with the circuit of a few years their tale is told. Fixed stars are the only ones that are constant; their position in the firmament is secure; they shine with a light of their own; their effect today is the same as it was yesterday, because, having no parallax, their appearance does not alter with a difference in our standpoint. They belong not to one system, one nation only, but to the universe. And just because they are so very far away, it is usually many years before their light is visible to the inhabitants of this earth.","source":""},{"quote":"No difference of rank, position, or birth is so great as the gulf that spearates the countless millions who use their head only in the service of their belly, in other words, look upon it as an instrument of the will, and those very few and rare persons who have the courage to say: \'No! It is too good for that; my head shall be active only in its own service; it shall try to comprehend the wondrous and varied spectacle of this world\', and then reproduce it in some form, whether as art or as literature, that may answer to my character as an individual. These are the truly noble, the real noblesse of the world. The others are serfs and go with the soil. Of course, I am here referring to those who have not only the courage, but also the call, and therfore the right, to order the head to quit the service of the will; with a result that proves the sacrifice to have been worth the making.

Therefore in the choice thereof it is not fastidious, as is testified by the miserable and wretched pastimes to which people have recourse. … The principal result of this inner vacuity is the craze for society, diversion, amusement, and luxury of every kind which lead many to extravagance and so to misery. Nothing protects us so surely from this wrong turning as inner wealth, the wealth of the mind, for the more eminent it becomes, the less room does it leave for boredom.

It is the alpha and omega of the oldest book in the world, the sacred Vedas, whose dogmatic part, or rather esoteric teaching, is found in the Upanishads. There, in almost every page this profound doctrine lies enshrined; with tireless repetition, in countless adaptations, by many varied parables and similes it is expounded and inculcated.

Later on, the New Platonists were steeped in the same … In the ninth century we find it unexpectedly appearing in Europe. It kindles the spirit of no less a divine than Johannes Scotus Erigena, who endeavours to clothe it with the forms and terminology of the Christian religion. Among the Mohammedans we detect it again in the rapt mysticism of the Sufi. In the West Giordano Bruno cannot resist the impulse to utter it aloud; but his reward is a death of shame and torture.

This is due to the fact that, when many people gather together to share one common emotion, the total psyche emerging from the group is below the level of the individual psyche.

There they found the abundance of visions, the fruits of the desert, the wondrous flowers of the soul. Think diligently about the images that the ancients have left behind.

The less we understand of what our [forebears] sought, the less we understand ourselves, and thus we help with all our might to rob the individual of his roots and his guiding instincts, so that he becomes a particle in the mass, ruled only by what Neitzche called the spirit of gravity.","source":""},{"quote":"The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life. Only if we know that the thing which truly matters is the infinite can we avoid fixing our interests upon futilities, and upon all kinds of goals which are not of real importance. Thus we demand that the world grant us recognition for qualities which we regard as personal possessions: our talent or our beauty. The more a man lays stress on false possessions, and the less sensitivity he has for what is essential, the less satisfying is his life. He feels limited because he has limited aims, and the result is envy and jealousy. If we understand and feel that here in this life we already have a link with the infinite, desires and attitudes change.","source":""},{"quote":"The seed of a mountain pine contains the whole future tree in a latent form; but each seed falls at a certain time onto a particular place, in which there are a number of special factors, such as the quality of the soil and the stones, the slope of the land, and its exposure to the sun and wind. The latent totality of the pine in the seed reacts to these cicumstances by avoiding the stones and inclining toward the sun, with the result that the tree\'s growth is shaped. Thus an individual pine slowly comes into existence, constituting the fulfillment of its totality, its emergence into the realm of reality. Without the living tree, the image of the pine is only a possibility or an abstract idea. Again, the realization of this uniqueness in the individual man is the goal of the process of individuation.","source":""},{"quote":"In so far as society is itself composed of de-individualized human beings, it is completely at the mercy of ruthless individualists. Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes – it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hand of a single madman. Unfortunately, this realization does not seem to have penetrated very far - and our blindness is extremely dangerous.","source":""},{"quote":"The real mystery does not behave mysteriously or secretively; it speaks a secret language, it adumbrates itself by a variety of images which all indicate its true nature. I am not speaking of a secret personally guarded by someone, with a content known to its possessor, but of a mystery, a matter or circumstance which is \'secret\', i.e., known only through vague hints but essentially unknown. The real nature of matter was unknown to the alchemist: he knew it only in hints. In seeking to explore it he projected the unconscious into the darkness of matter in order to illuminate it. In order to explain the mystery of matter he projected yet another mystery - his own psychic background -into what was to be explained: Obscurum per obscurius, ignotum per ignotius! This procedure was not, of course, intentional; it was an involuntary occurrence.","source":""},{"quote":"The alchemist saw the union of opposites under the symbol of the tree, and it is therefore not surprising that the unconscious of present-day man, who no longer feels at home in his world and can base his existence neither on the past that is no more nor on the future that is yet to be, should hark back to the symbol of the cosmic tree rooted in this world and growing up to heaven - the tree that is also man. In the history of symbols this tree is described as the way of life itself, a growing into that which eternally is and does not change; which springs from the union of opposites and, by its eternal presence, also makes that union possible. It seems as if it were only through an experience of symbolic reality that man, vainly seeking his own \'existence\' and making a philosophy out of it, can find his way back to a world in which he is no longer a stranger.","source":""},{"quote":"The difference between the \'natural\' individuation process, which runs its course unconsciously, and the one which is consciously realized, is tremendous. In the first case consciousness nowhere intervenes; the end remains as dark as the beginning. In the second case so much darkness comes to light that the personality is permeated with light, and consciousness necessarily gains in scope and insight. The encounter between conscious and unconscious has to ensure that the light which shines in the darkness is not only comprehended by the darkness, but comprehends it. The filius solis et lunae (the son of the Sun and Moon) is the possible result as well as the symbol of this union of opposites. It is the alpha and omega of the process, the mediator and intermedius. \'It has a thousand names\', say the alchemists, meaning that the source from which the individuation process rises and the goal toward which it aims is nameless, ineffable.","source":""},{"quote":"Be silent and listen: have you recognized your madness and do you admit it? Have you noticed that all your foundations are completely mired in madness? Do you not want to recognize your madness and welcome it in a friendly manner? You wanted to accept everything. So accept madness too. Let the light of your madness shine, and it will suddenly dawn on you. Madness is not to be despised and not to be feared, but instead you should give it life...If you want to find paths, you should also not spurn madness, since it makes up such a great part of your nature...Be glad that you can recognize it, for you will thus avoid becoming its victim. Madness is a special form of the spirit and clings to all teachings and philosophies, but even more to daily life, since life itself is full of craziness and at bottom utterly illogical. Man strives toward reason only so that he can make rules for himself. Life itself has no rules. That is its mystery and its unknown law. What you call knowledge is an attempt to impose something comprehensible on life.","source":""},{"quote":"The fact that a man who goes his own way ends in ruin means nothing... He must obey his own law, as if it were a daemon whispering to him of new and wonderful paths... There are not a few who are called awake by the summons of the voice, whereupon they are at once set apart from the others, feeling themselves confronted with a problem about which the others know nothing. In most cases it is impossible to explain to the others what has happened, for any understanding is walled off by impenetrable prejudices. \'You are no different from anybody else,\' they will chorus or, \'there\'s no such thing\', and even if there is such a thing, it is immediately branded as \'morbid\'... He is at once set apart and isolated, as he has resolved to obey the law that commands him from within. \'His own law!\' everybody will cry. But he knows better: it is the law...The only meaningful life is a life that strives for the individual realization--absolute and unconditional--of its own particular law...To the extent that a man is untrue to the law of his being...he has failed to realize his own life\'s meaning. The undiscovered vein within us is a living part of the psyche; classical Chinese philosophy names this interior way \'Tao\', and likens it to a flow of water that moves irresistibly towards its goal. To rest in Tao means fulfillment, wholeness, one\'s destination reached, one\'s mission done; the beginning, end, and perfect realization of the meaning of existence innate in all things.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"C.G.

But people themselves deal very differently with this, their higher self, and often act out the role of their own self, to the extent that they later keep imitating what they were in those moments. Some regard their ideal with shy humility and would like to deny it: they fear their higher self because, when it speaks, it speaks demandingly.

But what is it that constrains the individual to fear his neighbor, to think and act like a member of a herd, and to have no joy in himself? Modesty, perhaps, in a few rare cases. With the great majority it is indolence, inertia. … Men are even lazier than they are timid, and fear most of all the inconveniences with which unconditional honesty and nakedness would burden them.

There is no regular path which leads from these intuitions into the land of ghostly schemata, the land of abstractions. There exists no word for these intuitions; when man sees them he grows dumb, or else he speaks only in forbidden metaphors and in unheard — of combinations of concepts. He does this so that by shattering and mocking the old conceptual barriers he may at least correspond creatively to the impression of the powerful present intuition.","source":""},{"quote":"The drive toward the formation of metaphors is the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense with man himself. This drive is not truly vanquished and scarcely subdued by the fact that a regular and rigid new world is constructed as its prison from its own ephemeral products, the concepts. It seeks a new realm and another channel for its activity, and it finds this in myth and in art generally. This drive continually confuses the conceptual categories and cells by bringing forward new transferences, metaphors, and metonymies. It continually manifests an ardent desire to refashion the world which presents itself to waking man, so that it will be as colorful, irregular, lacking in results and coherence, charming, and eternally new as the world of dreams. Indeed, it is only by means of the rigid and regular web of concepts that the waking man clearly sees that he is awake; and it is precisely because of this that he sometimes thinks that he must be dreaming when this web of concepts is torn by art.","source":""},{"quote":"The heaviest burden: What, if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life, as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life must return to you, all in the same succession and sequence — even this spider and this moonlight between the trees and even this moment and I myself.

The old idea that words possess magical powers is false; but its falsity is the distortion of a very important truth. Words do have a magical effect — but not in the way that magicians supposed, and not on the objects they were trying to influence. Words are magical in the way they affect the minds of those who use them. \'A mere matter of words\', we say contemptuously, forgetting that words have power to mould men\'s thinking, to canalize their feeling, to direct their willing and acting.

What comes out at the other end is a measly trickle of the kind of consciousness which will help us to stay alive on the surface of this particular planet.

Every individual is at once the beneficiary and the victim of the linguistic tradition into which he or she has been born - the beneficiary inasmuch as language gives access to he accumulated records of other people\'s experience, the victim in so far as it confirms him in the belief that reduced awareness is the only awareness and as it be-devils his sense of reality, so that he is all too apt to take his concepts for data, his words for actual things.

Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish the illusion of individuality, but in fact they have been to a great extent deindividualized.

They are permitted to ratify the decisions of their betters and to lend their support to one or another of them, but not to interfere with matters—like public policy—that are none of their business.","source":""},{"quote":"If you quietly accept and go along no matter what your feelings are, ultimately you internalize what you\'re saying, because it\'s too hard to believe one thing and say another.

And that makes sense. If you\'ve resisted the temptation to tell the teacher, You\'re an asshole, which maybe he or she is, and if you don\'t say, That\'s idiotic, when you get a stupid assignment, you will gradually pass through the required filters. You will end up at a good college and eventually with a good job.","source":""},{"quote":"...Board of Directors have to make certain kinds of decisions, and those decisions are pretty narrowly constrained. They have to be committed to increasing profit share and market share. That means they\'re going to be forced to try to limit wages, to limit quality, to use advertising in a way that sells goods even if the product is lousy. Who tells them to do this? Nobody. But if they stopped doing it, they\'d be out of business. What is the New York Times? It\'s just a corporation. If investors and advertisers don\'t want to support it, and the government doesn\'t want to give it the special privileges and advantages that make it a newspaper of record, it\'s out of business.","source":""},{"quote":"Of course it\'s extremely easy to say, the heck with it.

You see a kid eating an ice cream cone and you notice there\'s no cop around and you can take the ice cream cone from him because you\'re bigger and walk away. You can do that.

For example, I don\'t try to hide my commitments, and the Washington Post and New York Times shouldn\'t do it either. However, they must do it, because this mask of balance and objectivity is a crucial part of the propaganda function. In fact, they actually go beyond that. They try to present themselves as adversarial to power, as subversive, digging away at powerful institutions and undermining them.

In fact, what we\'ve seen over the years—and it\'s hard to be optimistic in the twentieth century, which is one of the worst centuries in human history in terms of atrocities and terror and so on—but still, over the years, including the twentieth century, there is a widening of the moral realm, bringing in broader and broader domains of individuals who are regarded as moral agents.","source":""},{"quote":"We\'re not analyzing the media on Mars or in the eighteenth century or something like that.

I mean, there are very few people who are going to look into the mirror and say, \'That person I see is a savage monster\'; instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do. If you ask the CEO of some major corporation what he does he will say, in all honesty, that he is slaving 20 hours a day to provide his customers with the best goods or services he can and creating the best possible working conditions for his employees. But then you take a look at what the corporation does, the effect of its legal structure, the vast inequalities in pay and conditions, and you see the reality is something far different.","source":""},{"quote":"My own concern is primarily the terror and violence carried out by my own state, for two reasons. For one thing, because it happens to be the larger component of international violence. But also for a much more important reason than that; namely, I can do something about it. So even if the U.S. was responsible for 2 percent of the violence in the world instead of the majority of it, it would be that 2 percent I would be primarily responsible for. And that is a simple ethical judgment. That is, the ethical value of one\'s actions depends on their anticipated and predictable consequences. It is very easy to denounce the atrocities of someone else. That has about as much ethical value as denouncing atrocities that took place in the 18th century.","source":""},{"quote":"The United States is one of the high contracting parties to the Geneva Convention, therefore it is obligated, by its domestic law and highest commitments, to prosecute the perpetrators of grave breaches of the conventions.

And it\'s worth remembering the context. It is not any old convention. These are the conventions established to criminalize the practices of the Nazis, right after the Second World War.

Now, under capitalism we can\'t have democracy by definition. Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist; that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level -there\'s a little bargaining, a little give and take, but the line of authority is perfectly straightforward. Just as I\'m opposed to political fascism, I\'m opposed to economic fascism.

These are ordinary people, not professionals, who are applying their intelligence and analytic skills in these areas and accumulating quite a lot of knowledge and, for all I know, understanding.

So what\'s left? Well, one thing that\'s left is sports -so you put a lot of the intelligence and the thought and the self-confidence into that.

If people start thinking you get all these problems that I quoted before. They won\'t have enough humility to submit to a civil rule or they\'ll start trying to press their demands in the political arena and have ideas of their own, instead of beleiving what they\'re told.

The candidates are trained, carefully trained, to project a certain image.

Meanwhile, the enlightened states, England, the United States, others, resorted to massive state intervention to protect private power, and still do. That\'s right up to the present. I mean, the Reagan administration for example was the most protectionist in post-war American history. Virtually the entire dynamic economy in the United States is based crucially on state initiative and intervention: computers, the internet, telecommunication, automation, pharmaceutical, you just name it. Run through it, and you find massive ripoffs of the public, meaning, a system in which under one guise or another the public pays the costs and takes the risks, and profit is privatized.

In such circumstances you\'ve got to divert the bewildered herd, because if they start noticing this they may not like it, since they\'re the ones suffering from it.

Jefferson specifically advocated it. We don\'t have it anymore, it\'s sort of there in legislation but it\'s gone. What we need is different social policies. And social policies which ought to be funded by the people who are going to benefit from it, that\'s the general public.

It may be comforting to pretend that our enemies hate our freedoms, as President Bush stated, but it is hardly wise to ignore the real world, which conveys different lessons. The president is not the first to ask: Why do they hate us? In a staff discussion 44 years ago, President Eisenhower described the campaign of hatred against us in the Arab world not by the governments but by the people.

First of all, spectator sports make people more passive, because you\'re not doing them; you\'re watching somebody doing them. Secondly, they engender jingoist and chauvinist attitudes, sometimes to quite an extreme degree. I saw something in the newspapers just a day or two ago about how high-school teams are now so antagonistic and passionately committed to winning at all costs that they had to abandon the standard handshake before or after the game. These kids can\'t even do civil things like greeting one another because they\'re ready to kill one another.

If you take an economics or a political science course, you\'re taught that humans are supposed to be rational wealth accumulators, each acting as an individual to maximize his own wealth in the market. The market is regarded as democratic because everybody has a vote. Of course, some have more votes than others because your votes depend on the number of dollars you have, but everybody participates and therefore it\'s called democratic. Well, suppose that we believe what we are taught. It follows that if there are dollars to be made, you destroy the environment. The reason is elementary. The people who are going to be harmed by this are your grandchildren, and they don\'t have any votes in the market. Their interests are worth zero. Anybody that pays attention to their grandchildren\'s interests is being irrational, because what you\'re supposed to do is maximize your own interests, measured by wealth, right now.

There are virtually no moderate Republicans in what\'s called the Republican Party and virtually no liberal Democrats in what\'s called the Democratic sic Party. It\'s basically a party of what would be moderate Republicans and similarly, Richard Nixon would be way at the left of the political spectrum today. Eisenhower would be in outer space.

And this naive faith requires necessary illusion, and emotionally potent oversimplifications, which are provided by the myth-maker to keep the ordinary person on course. It\'s not the case, as the naive might think, that indoctrination is inconsistent with democracy. Rather, as this whole line of thinkers observes, it is the essence of democracy. The point is that in a military state or a feudal state or what we would now call a totalitarian state, it doesn\'t much matter because you\'ve got a bludgeon over their heads and you can control what they do. But when the state loses the bludgeon, when you can\'t control people by force, and when the voice of the people can be heard, you have this problem—it may make people so curious and so arrogant that they don\'t have the humility to submit to a civil rule Clement Walker, 1661 and therefore you have to control what people think.

The driving force of modern industrial civilization has been individual material gain, which is accepted as legitimate, even praiseworthy, on the grounds that private vices yield public benefits, in the classic formulation.

It can only persist, with whatever suffering and injustice that it entails, as long as it is possible to pretend that the destructive forces that humans create are limited, that the world is an infinite resource, and that the world is an infinite garbage can. At this stage of history either one of two things is possible. Either the general population will take control of its own destiny and will concern itself with community interests, guided by values of solidarity, sympathy and concern for others, or alternatively there will be no destiny for anyone to control. As long as some specialized class is in a position of authority, it is going to set policy in the special interests that it serves. But the conditions of survival, let alone justice, require rational social planning in the interests of the community as a whole, and by now that means the global community. The question is whether privileged elite should dominate mass communication and should use this power as they tell us they must—namely to impose necessary illusions, to manipulate and deceive the stupid majority and remove them from the public arena.

We will eventually want to arrange to have a special, red button marked “surprise” built into the panel. Touch that button and what happens? We will suddenly disappear from our normal consciousness and find ourselves in a situation very much like the one we are now in, where we feel ourselves to be a little bit out of control, subject to surprises, and subject to the whims of an unpredictable universe.","source":""},{"quote":"To understand music, you must listen to it. But so long as you are thinking, \'I am listening to this music,\' you are not listening. To understand joy or fear, you must be wholly and undividedly aware of it. So long as you are calling it names and saying, \'I am happy,\' or \'I am afraid,\' you are not being aware of it. Fear, pain, sorrow, and boredom must remain problems if we do not understand them, but understanding requires a single and undivided mind. This, surely, is the meaning of that strange saying, \'If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.\'","source":""},{"quote":"That the undivided mind is aware of experience as a unity, of the world as itself, and that the whole nature of mind and awareness is to be one with what it knows, suggests a state that would usually be called love. For the love that expresses itself in creative action is something much more than an emotion. It is not something which you can \'feel\' and \'know\', remember and define. Love is the organizing and unifying principle which makes the world a universe and the disintegrated mass a community. It is the very essence and character of mind, and becomes manifest in action when the mind is whole.","source":""},{"quote":"The art of meditation is a way of getting into touch with reality, and the reason for it is that most civilized people are out of touch with reality because they confuse the world as it with the world as they think about it and talk about it and describe it. For on the one hand there is the real world and on the other there is a whole system of symbols about that world which we have in our minds. These are very very useful symbols, all civilization depends on them, but like all good things they have their disadvantages, and the principle disadvantage of symbols is that we confuse them with reality, just as we confuse money with actual wealth.","source":""},{"quote":"We could say that meditation doesn\'t have a reason or doesn\'t have a purpose. In this respect it\'s unlike almost all other things we do except perhaps making music and dancing. When we make music we don\'t do it in order to reach a certain point, such as the end of the composition. If that were the purpose of music then obviously the fastest players would be the best. Also, when we are dancing we are not aiming to arrive at a particular place on the floor as in a journey. When we dance, the journey itself is the point, as when we play music the playing itself is the point. And exactly the same thing is true in meditation. Meditation is the discovery that the point of life is always arrived at in the immediate moment.","source":""},{"quote":"Self-knowledge leads to wonder, and wonder to curiosity and investigation, so that nothing interests people more than people, even if only one\'s own person. Every intelligent individual wants to know what makes him tick, and yet is at once fascinated and frustrated by the fact that oneself is the most difficult of all things to know. For the human organism is, apparently, the most complex of all organisms, and while one has the advantage of knowing one\'s own organism so intimately—from the inside—there is also the disadvantage of being so close to it that one can never quite get at it. Nothing so eludes conscious inspection as consciousness itself. This is why the root of consciousness has been called, paradoxically, the unconscious.","source":""},{"quote":"All information will come in by super-realistic television and other electronic devices as yet in the planning stage or barely imagined. In one way this will enable the individual to extend himself anywhere without moving his body—even to distant regions of space. But this will be a new kind of individual—an individual with a colossal external nervous system reaching out and out into infinity. And this electronic nervous system will be so interconnected that all individuals plugged in will tend to share the same thoughts, the same feelings, and the same experiences. There may be specialized types, just as there are specialized cells and organs in our bodies. For the tendency will be for all individuals to coalesce into a single bio-electronic body.","source":""},{"quote":"Successful meditation brings about realizations: That we are no longer this poor little stranger and afraid in a world it never made. But that you are this universe and you are creating it in every moment... Because you see it starts now, it didn\'t begin in the past, there was no past. See, if the universe began in the past when that happened it was now; see, but it\'s still now — and the universe is still beginning now, and it\'s trailing off like the wake of a ship from now, and that wake fades out so does the past. You can look back there to explain things, but the explanation disappears. You\'ll never find it there. ... Things are not explained by the past, they are explained by what Happens Now. That Creates the past, and it begins here... That\'s the birth of responsibility.","source":""},{"quote":"Our image of man is changing as it becomes clearer and clearer that the human being is notsimply and only his physical organism. My body is also my total environment, and this must be measured by light-years in the billions. Hitherto the poets and philosophers of science have used the vast expanse and duration of the universe as a pretext for reflections on the unimportance of man, forgetting that man with that enchanted loom, the brain is precisely what transforms this immense electrical pulsation into light and color, shape and sound, large and small, hard and heavy, long and short. In knowing the world we humanize it, and if, as we discover it, we are astonished at its dimensions and its complexity, we should be just as astonished that we have the brains to perceive it.","source":""},{"quote":"Every individual is a unique manifestation of the Whole, as every branch is a particular outreaching of the tree. To manifest individuality, every branch must have a sensitive connection with the tree, just as our independently moving and differentiated fingers must have a sensitive connection with the whole body. The point, which can hardly be repeated too often, is that differentiation is not separation. The head and the feet are different, but not separate, and though man is not connected to the universe by exactly the same physical relation as branch to tree or feet to head, he is nonetheless connected—and by physical relations of fascinating complexity. The death of the individual is not disconnection but simply withdrawal. The corpse is like a footprint or an echo—the dissolving trace of something which the Self has ceased to do.","source":""},{"quote":"If you awaken from this illusion, and you understand that black implies white, self implies other, life implies death — or shall I say, death implies life — you can conceive yourself. Not conceive, but feel yourself, not as a stranger in the world, not as someone here on sufferance, on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental. What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself. So, say in Hindu mythology, they say that the world is the drama of God. God is not something in Hindu mythology with a white beard that sits on a throne, that has royal perogatives. God in Indian mythology is the self, Satcitananda. Which means sat, that which is, chit, that which is consciousness; that which is ananda is bliss. In other words, what exists, reality itself is gorgeous, it is the fullness of total joy.","source":""},{"quote":"Let\'s suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream that you wanted to dream.

And after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each, you would say \'Well, that was pretty great.\' But now let\'s have a surprise. Let\'s have a dream which isn\'t under control. Where something is gonna happen to me that I don\'t know what it\'s going to be. And you would dig that and come out of that and say \'Wow, that was a close shave, wasn\'t it?\' And then you would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream. And finally, you would dream ... where you are now.

And all that ink spread. And in the middle, it\'s dense, isn\'t it? And as it gets out on the edge, the little droplets get finer and finer and make more complicated patterns, see? So in the same way, there was a big bang at the beginning of things and it spread. And you and I, sitting here in this room, as complicated human beings, are way, way out on the fringe of that bang. We are the complicated little patterns on the end of it. Very interesting. But so we define ourselves as being only that. If you think that you are only inside your skin, you define yourself as one very complicated little curlique, way out on the edge of that explosion. Way out in space, and way out in time. Billions of years ago, you were a big bang, but now you\'re a complicated human being. And then we cut ourselves off, and don\'t feel that we\'re still the big bang. But you are. Depends how you define yourself. You are actually—if this is the way things started, if there was a big bang in the beginning— you\'re not something that\'s a result of the big bang. You\'re not something that is a sort of puppet on the end of the process. You are still the process. You are the big bang, the original force of the universe, coming on as whoever you are. When I meet you, I see not just what you define yourself as—Mr so-andso, Ms so-and-so, Mrs so-and-so—I see every one of you as the primordial energy of the universe coming on at me in this particular way.

Finally, the mind breaks the bounding sphere of the cosmos to a realization transcending all experiences of form - all symbolizations, all divinities: a realization of the ineluctable void.","source":""},{"quote":"Everywhere, no matter what the sphere of interest (whether religious, political, or personal), the really creative acts are represented as those deriving from some sort of dying to the world; and what happens in the interval of the hero\'s nonentity, so that he comes back as one reborn, made great and filled with creative power, mankind is also unanimous in declaring.

In a word: the first work of the hero is to retreat from the world scene of secondary effects to those causal zones of the psyche where the difficulties really reside, and there to clarify the difficulties, eradicate them in his own case (i.e., give battle to the nursery demons of his local culture) and break through to the undistorted, direct experience and assimilation of what C. G. Jung called the archetypal images.","source":""},{"quote":"The passage of the mythological hero may be overground, incidentally; fundamentally it is inward—into depths where obscure resistances are overcome, and long lost, forgotten powers are revivified, to be made available for the transfiguration of the world. ...Something of the light that blazes invisible within the abysses of its normally opaque materiality breaks forth, with an increasing uproar. The dreadful mutilations are then seen as shadows, only, of an immanent, imperishable eternity; time yields to glory; and the world sings with the prodigious, angelic, but perhaps finally monotonous, siren music of the spheres. Like happy families, the myths and the worlds redeemed are all alike.","source":""},{"quote":"The image of the cosmos must change with the development of the mind and knowledge; otherwise, the mythic statement is lost, and man becomes dissociated from the very basis of his own religious experience.

That is to say, they were correct in terms of the scientific image of that age. So there must be a scientifically validated image.

It is only those who know neither an inner call nor an outer doctrine whose plight is truly desperate; that is to say, most of us today, in this labyrinth without and within the heart.

Eternity isn\'t a long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time. Eternity is that dimension of here and now which thinking and time cuts out. This is it. And if you don\'t get it here, you won\'t get it anywhere. And the experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life. There\'s a wonderful formula that the Buddhists have for the Bodhisattva, the one whose being (sattva) is illumination (bodhi), who realizes his identity with eternity and at the same time his participation in time. And the attitude is not to withdraw from the world when you realize how horrible it is, but to realize that this horror is simply the foreground of a wonder and to come back and participate in it. All life is sorrowful is the first Buddhist saying, and it is. It wouldn\'t be life if there were not temporality involved which is sorrow.","source":""},{"quote":"Man should not be in the service of society, society should be in the service of man. When man is in the service of society, you have a monster state, and that\'s what is threatening the world at this minute. ...Certainly Star Wars has a valid mythological perspective. It shows the state as a machine and asks, \'Is the machine going to crush humanity or serve humanity?\' Humanity comes not from the machine but from the heart. What I see in Star Wars is the same problem that Faust gives us: Mephistopheles, the machine man, can provide us with all the means, and is thus likely to determine the aims of life as well. But of course the characteristic of Faust, which makes him eligible to be saved, is that he seeks aims that are not those of the machine. Now, when Luke Skywalker unmasks his father, he is taking off the machine role that the father has played. The father was the uniform. That is power, the state role.","source":""},{"quote":"To become—in Jung\'s terms—individuated, to live as a released individual, one has to know how and when to put on and to put off the masks of one\'s various life roles. \'When in Rome, do as the Romans do,\' and when at home, do not keep on the mask of the role you play in the Senate chamber. But this, finally, is not easy, since some of the masks cut deep. They include judgment and moral values. They include one\'s pride, ambition, and achievement. They include one\'s infatuations. It is a common thing to be overly impressed by and attached to masks, either some mask of one\'s own or the mana-masks of others. The work of individuation, however, demands that one should not be compulsively affected in this way. The aim of individuation requires that one should find and then learn to live out of one\'s own center, in control of one\'s for and against. And this cannot be achieved by enacting and responding to any general masquerade of fixed roles.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"Joseph Campbell Foundation","link":"https://www.jcf.org/"},{"title":"Joseph Campbell - Topic - YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtsNRwJVIGt6K99xRblum6w/videos"}]},{"name":"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","slug":"solzhenitsyn","bio":"Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was a Russian novelist, historian, and short story writer.

We all want to escape occasionally. But science fiction is often very far from escapism, in fact you might say that science fiction is escape into reality...

In fact I can\'t think of any form of literature which is more concerned with real issues, reality.","source":""},{"quote":"There is the possibility that humankind can outgrow its infantile tendencies, as I suggested in Childhood\'s End. But it is amazing how childishly gullible humans are.

They may be summed up by the phrases: (1) It\'s completely impossible — don\'t waste my time; (2) It\'s possible, but it\'s not worth doing; (3) I said it was a good idea all along.

The man who looks at the onrushing tidal wave, the descending avalanche, or the spinning funnel of the tornado, yet makes no attempt to flee, is not necessarily paralyzed with fright or resigned to an unavoidable fate. He may simply be unable to believe that the message of his eyes concerns him personally. It is all happening to somebody else.","source":""},{"quote":"We have a situation in which millions of vehicles, each a miracle of often unnecssary complication, are hurtling in all directions under the impulse of anything up to 200 horsepower. Many of them are the size of small houses and contain a couple of tons of sophisticated alloys — yet often carry a single passenger. They can travel at a hundred miles an hour, but are lucky if they average forty. In one lifetime they have consumed more irreplaceable fuel than has been used in the whole previous history of mankind. The roads to support them, inadequate though they are, cost as much as a small war; the analogy is a good one, for the casualties are on the same scale.","source":""},{"quote":"Communication technologies are necessary, but not sufficient, for us humans to get along with each other. This is why we still have many disputes and conflicts in the world. Technology tools help us to gather and disseminate information, but we also need qualities like tolerance and compassion to achieve greater understanding between peoples and nations. I have great faith in optimism as a guiding principle, if only because it offers us the opportunity of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I hope we\'ve learnt something from the most barbaric century in history — the 20th. I would like to see us overcome our tribal divisions and begin to think and act as if we were one family. That would be real globalisation…","source":""},{"quote":"Space can be mapped and crossed and occupied without definable limit; but it can never be conquered. When our race has reached its ultimate achievements, and the stars themselves are scattered no more widely than the seed of Adam, even then we shall still be like ants crawling on the face of the Earth. The ants have covered the world, but have they conquered it — for what do their countless colonies know of it, or of each other? So it will be with us as we spread out from Earth, loosening the bonds of kinship and understanding, hearing faint and belated rumors at second — or third — or thousandth hand of an ever dwindling fraction of the entire human race. Though the Earth will try to keep in touch with her children, in the end all the efforts of her archivists and historians will be defeated by time and distance, and the sheer bulk of material. For the numbers of distinct human societies or nations, when our race is twice its present age, may be far greater than the total number of all the men who have ever lived up to the present time. We have left the realm of comprehension in our vain effort to grasp the scale of the universe; so it must ever be, sooner rather than later.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"The Arthur C.

They are \'inauthentic\' in that they do not belong to themselves, are not \'their own\' person, do not act from their own center, do not see reality on its terms; they are the one-dimensional men totally immersed in the fictional games being played in their society, unable to transcend their social conditioning: the corporation men in the West, the bureaucrats in the East, the tribal men locked up in tradition-man everywhere who doesn\'t understand what it means to think for himself and who, if he did, would shrink back at the idea of such audacity and exposure.","source":""},{"quote":"How does one transcend himself; how does he open himself to new possibility? By realizing the truth of his situation, by dispelling the lie of his character, by breaking his spirit out of its conditioned prison. The enemy, for Kierkegaard as for Freud, is the Oedipus complex. The child has built up strategies and techniques for keeping his self-esteem in the face of the terror of his situation. These techniques become an armor that hold the person prisoner. The very defenses that he needs in order to move about with self-confidence and self-esteem become his life-long trap. In order to transcend himself he must break down that which he needs in order to live. Like Lear he must throw off all his \'cultural lendings\' and stand naked in the storm of life. Kierkegaard had no illusions about man\'s urge to freedom. He knew how comfortable people were inside the prison of their character defenses. Like many prisoners they are comfortable in their limited and protected routines, and the idea of a parole into the wide world of chance, accident, and choice terrifies them.","source":""},{"quote":"The key to the creative type is that he is separated out of the common pool of shared meanings. There is something in his life experience that makes him take in the world as a problem; as a result he has to make personal sense out of it. This holds true for all creative people to a greater or lesser extent, but it is especially obvious with the artist. Existence becomes a problem that needs an ideal answer; but when you no longer accept the collective solution to the problem of existence, then you must fashion your own. The work of art is, then, the ideal answer of the creative type to the problem of existence as he takes it in-not only the existence of the external world, but especially his own: who he is as a painfully separate person with nothing shared to lean on. He has to answer to the burden of his extreme individuation, his so painful isolation. He wants to know how to earn immortality as a result of his own unique gifts. His creative work is at the same time the expression of his heroism and the justification of it. It is his \'private religion\'-as Rank put it. Its uniqueness gives him personal immortality; it is his own \'beyond\' and not that of others.","source":""},{"quote":"There is the type of man who has great contempt for \'immediacy\', who tries to cultivate his interiority, base his pride on something deeper and inner, create a distance between himself and the average man. Kierkegaard calls this type of man the \'introvert.\' He is a little more concerned with what it means to be a person, with individuality and uniqueness. He enjoys solitude and withdraws periodically to reflect, perhaps to nurse ideas about his secret self, what it might be. This, after all is said and done, is the only real problem of life, the only worthwhile occupation preoccupation of man: What is one\'s true talent, his secret gift, his authentic vocation? In what way is one truly unique, and how can he express this uniqueness, give it form, dedicate it to something beyond himself? How can the person take his private inner being, the great mystery that he feels at the heart of himself, his emotions, his yearnings, and use them to live more distinctively, to enrich both himself and mankind with the peculiar quality of his talent? In adolescence, most of us throb with this dilemma, expressing it either with words and thoughts or with simple numb pain and longing. But usually life suck us up into standardized activities. The social hero-system into which we are born marks out paths for our heroism, paths to which we conform, to which we shape ourselves so that we can please others, become what they expect us to be. And instead of working our inner secret we gradually cover it over and forget it, while we become purely external men, playing successfully the standardized hero-game into which we happen to fall by accident, by family connection, by reflex patriotism, ro by the simple need to eat and the urge to procreate.","source":""}],"links":[{"title":"Ernest Becker Foundation","link":"http://ernestbecker.org/resources/"}]},{"name":"Frank Herbert","slug":"herbert","bio":"Frank Herbert was an American science fiction writer best known for the novel \'Dune\' and its five sequels.

At the moment the people who are using Shamanism and magic to shape our culture are advertisers. Rather than try to wake people up, their Shamanism is used as an opiate to tranquilize people, to make people more manipulable.

They are seen as simple entertainment; things with which we can fill 20 minutes, half an hour, while we\'re waiting to die.

I believe that magic is art and that art, whether it be writing, music, sculpture, or any other form is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words, or images, to achieve changes in consciousness. The very language about magic seems to be talking as much about writing or art as it is about supernatural events. A grimmoir for example, the book of spells is simply a fancy way of saying grammar. Indeed, to cast a spell, is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people\'s consciousness.

I see magic as a vantage point from which one can look down on the rest of consciousness. It\'s a point outside normal consciousness from which you can look at normal consciousness, it\'s a point outside beliefs from which you can look at beliefs. All beliefs are reality tunnels, to use Robert Anton Wilson\'s phrase. There is the Communist reality tunnel, the Feminist reality tunnel, all of which seem to be the whole of reality when you are in the middle of them.

Increasingly, they say ‘you don\'t need to have a religious experience, we are having that for you. That\'s what we are here for.

Our ideas of organisation, our different religions, our different economic systems, our ideas about it are the world. We are heading for a radical revision where you could say we are heading towards the end of the world, but more in the R.E.M. sense than the Revelation sense. That is what apocalypse means – revelation. I could square that with the end of the world, a revelation, a new way of looking at things, something that completely radicalises our notions of the where we were, when we were, what we were, something like that would constitute an end to the world in the kind of abstract – yet very real sense – that I am talking about. A change in the language, a change in the thinking, a change in the music. It wouldn\'t take much – one big scientific idea, or artistic idea, one good book, one good painting – who knows – we are at a critical point where the ideas are coming thicker and faster and stranger and stranger than they ever were before.

And these, with all their beast-heats, crowns and lightings, all their different colors, are become combined into the single whiteness that is godhead; that is all. This, then, is revelation. All is one, and all is deity, this beautiful undying fire of being that is everywhere about us; that we are. O man, o woman, know yourself, and know you are divine. Respect yourself, respect the least phenomenon of your existence as it were the breath of God. Know that our universe is all one place, a single firelit room, all time a single moment.

Checked in the dictionary, it means only revelation, although it obviously has also come to mean end of the world. As to what the end of the world means, I would say that probably depends on what we mean by world. I don\'t think this means the planet, or even the life forms upon the planet. I think the world is purely a construction of ideas, and not just the physical structures, but the mental structures, the ideologies that we\'ve erected, that is what I would call the world. Our political structures, philosophical structures, ideological frameworks, economies. These are actually imaginary things, and yet that is the framework that we have built our entire world upon. It strikes me that a strong enough wave of information could completely overturn and destroy all of that. A sudden realization that would change our entire perspective upon who we are and how we exist. History is a heat, it is the heat of accumulated information and accumulated complexity. As our culture progresses, we find that we gather more and more information and that we slowly start to move almost from a fluid to a vaporous state, as we approach the ultimate complexity of a social boiling point. I believe that our culture is turning to steam.","source":""},{"quote":"Much of magic as I understand it in the Western occult tradition is the search for the Self, with a capital S. This is understood as being the Great Work, as being the gold the alchemists sought, as being the Will, the Soul, the thing we have inside us that is behind the intellect, the body, the dreams. The inner dynamo of us, if you like. Now this is the single most important thing that we can ever attain, the knowledge of our own Self. And yet there are a frightening amount of people who seem to have the urge not just to ignore the Self, but actually seem to have the urge to obliterate themselves. This is horrific, but you can almost understand the desire to simply wipe out that awareness, because it\'s too much of a responsibility to actually posses such a thing as a soul, such a precious thing. What if you break it? What if you lose it? Mightn\'t it be best to anesthetize it, to deaden it, to destroy it, to not have to live with the pain of struggling towards it and trying to keep it pure? I think that the way that people immerse themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in television, in any of the addictions that our culture throws up, can be seen as a deliberate attempt to destroy any connection between themselves and the responsibility of accepting and owning a higher Self and then having to maintain it.","source":""},{"quote":"As I understand the theory of period information doubling, this states that if we take one period of human information as being the time between the invention of the first hand axe, say around 50,000 BC and 1 AD, then this is one period of human information and we can measure it by how many human inventions we came up during that time. Then we see how long it takes for us to have twice as many inventions. This means that human information has doubled. As it turns out, after the first 50,000-year period, the second period is about 1500 years, say around the time of the Renaissance. By then we have twice as much information. To double again, human information took a couple of hundred years. The period speeds up—between 1960 and 1970, human information doubled. At the last count human information was doubling around every 18 months. Further to this, there is a point sometime around 2015 where human information is doubling every thousandth of a second. This means that in each thousandth of a second we will have accumulated more information than we have in the entire previous history of the world. At this point I believe that all bets are off. I cannot imagine the kind of culture that might exist after such a flashpoint of knowledge.
